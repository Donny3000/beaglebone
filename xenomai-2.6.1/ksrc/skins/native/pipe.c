 * Message pipe services.
 *
 * A message pipe is a two-way communication channel between Xenomai
 * tasks and standard Linux processes using regular file I/O
 * operations on a pseudo-device. Pipes can be operated in a
 * message-oriented fashion so that message boundaries are preserved,
 * and also in byte streaming mode from real-time to standard Linux
 * processes for optimal throughput.
 *
 * Xenomai tasks open their side of the pipe using the
 * rt_pipe_create() service; standard Linux processes do the same by
 * opening one of the /dev/rtpN special devices, where N is the minor
 * number agreed upon between both ends of each pipe. Additionally,
 * named pipes are available through the registry support, which
 * automatically creates a symbolic link from entries under
 * /proc/xenomai/registry/native/pipes/ to the corresponding special
 * device file.

/**
 * @fn int rt_pipe_create(RT_PIPE *pipe,const char *name,int minor, size_t poolsize)
 * @brief Create a message pipe.
 *
 * This service opens a bi-directional communication channel allowing
 * data exchange between Xenomai tasks and standard Linux
 * processes. Pipes natively preserve message boundaries, but can also
 * be used in byte stream mode from Xenomai tasks to standard Linux
 * processes.
 *
 * rt_pipe_create() always returns immediately, even if no Linux
 * process has opened the associated special device file yet. On the
 * contrary, the non real-time side could block upon attempt to open
 * the special device file until rt_pipe_create() is issued on the
 * same pipe from a Xenomai task, unless O_NONBLOCK has been specified to
 * the open(2) system call.
 *
 * @param pipe The address of a pipe descriptor Xenomai will use to store
 * the pipe-related data.  This descriptor must always be valid while
 * the pipe is active therefore it must be allocated in permanent
 * memory.
 *
 * @param name An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * message pipe. When non-NULL and non-empty, this string is copied to
 * a safe place into the descriptor, and passed to the registry
 * package if enabled for indexing the created pipe.
 *
 * Named pipes are supported through the use of the registry. When the
 * registry support is enabled, passing a valid @a name parameter when
 * creating a message pipe subsequently allows standard Linux
 * processes to follow a symbolic link from
 * /proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/@a name in order to reach the
 * associated special device (i.e. /dev/rtp*), so that the specific @a
 * minor information does not need to be known from those processes
 * for opening the proper device file. In such a case, both sides of
 * the pipe only need to agree upon a symbolic name to refer to the
 * same data path, which is especially useful whenever the @a minor
 * number is picked up dynamically using an adaptive algorithm, such
 * as passing P_MINOR_AUTO as @a minor value.
 *
 * @param minor The minor number of the device associated with the
 * pipe.  Passing P_MINOR_AUTO causes the minor number to be
 * auto-allocated. In such a case, the @a name parameter must be valid
 * so that user-space processes may subsequently follow the symbolic
 * link that will be automatically created from
 * /proc/xenomai/registry/pipes/@a name to the allocated pipe device
 * entry (i.e. /dev/rtp*).
 *
 * @param poolsize Specifies the size of a dedicated buffer pool for the
 * pipe. Passing 0 means that all message allocations for this pipe are
 * performed on the system heap.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if the system fails to get enough dynamic
 * memory from the global real-time heap in order to register the
 * pipe, or if not enough memory could be obtained from the selected
 * buffer pool for allocating the internal streaming buffer.
 *
 * - -EEXIST is returned if the @a name is already in use by some
 * registered object.
 *
 * - -ENODEV is returned if @a minor is different from P_MINOR_AUTO
 * and is not a valid minor number for the pipe special device either
 * (i.e. /dev/rtp*).
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if @a minor is already open.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if this service was called from an
 * asynchronous context.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: possible.

 *
 * @param timeout The number of clock ticks to wait for some message

 * distinguished from an empty message return, where *msgp points to a

 * you to actually send less data than you reserved using the

 *
 * - P_URGENT causes the message to be prepended to the output
 * queue, ensuring a LIFO ordering.
 *
 * - P_NORMAL causes the message to be appended to the output
 * queue, ensuring a FIFO ordering.

 * This service writes a complete message to be received from the
 * associated special device. rt_pipe_write() always preserves message
 * boundaries, which means that all data sent through a single call of
 * this service will be gathered in a single read(2) operation from
 * the special device. This service differs from rt_pipe_send() in
 * that it accepts a pointer to the raw data to be sent, instead of a
 * canned message buffer. This call is useful whenever the caller does
 * not need to prepare the message contents separately from its
 * sending.
 *
 * @param pipe The descriptor address of the pipe to write to.
 *
 * @param buf The address of the first data byte to send. The
 * data will be copied to an internal buffer before transmission.
 *
 * @param size The size in bytes of the message (payload data
 * only). Zero is a valid value, in which case the service returns
 * immediately without sending any message.
 *
 * @param mode A set of flags affecting the operation:
 *
 * - P_URGENT causes the message to be prepended to the output
 * queue, ensuring a LIFO ordering.
 *
 * - P_NORMAL causes the message to be appended to the output
 * queue, ensuring a FIFO ordering.
 *
 * @return Upon success, this service returns @a size. Upon error, one
 * of the following error codes is returned:
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if @a pipe is not a pipe descriptor.
 *
 * - -ENOMEM is returned if not enough buffer space is available to
 * complete the operation.
 *
 * - -EIDRM is returned if @a pipe is a closed pipe descriptor.
 *
 * - -ENODEV or -EBADF are returned if @a pipe is scrambled.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Interrupt service routine
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: possible.
 *
 * @note Writing data to a pipe before any peer has opened the
 * associated special device is allowed. The output will be buffered
 * until then, only restricted by the available memory in the relevant
 * buffer pool (see rt_pipe_create()).

 * performing other tasks.
 *
 * @param pipe The descriptor address of the pipe to monitor.
 *
 * @param fn The notification handler. This user-provided routine will
 * be passed the address of the message pipe descriptor receiving the
 * event, the event code, and an optional argument.  Four events are
 * currently defined:
 *
 * - P_EVENT_INPUT is sent when the user-space endpoint writes to the
 *   pipe, which means that some input is pending for the kernel-based
 *   endpoint. The argument is the size of the incoming message.
 *
 * - P_EVENT_OUTPUT is sent when the user-space endpoint successfully
 *   reads a complete buffer from the pipe. The argument is the size
 *   of the outgoing message.
 *
 * - P_EVENT_CLOSE is sent when the user-space endpoint is closed. The
     argument is always 0.
 *
 * - P_EVENT_NOBUF is sent when no memory is available from the kernel
 * pool to hold the message currently sent from the user-space
 * endpoint. The argument is the size of the failed allocation. Upon
 * return from the handler, the caller will block and retry until
 * enough space is available from the pool; during that process, the
 * handler might be called multiple times, each time a new attempt to
 * get the required memory fails.
 *
 * The P_EVENT_INPUT and P_EVENT_OUTPUT events are fired on behalf of
 * a fully atomic context; therefore, care must be taken to keep their
 * overhead low. In those cases, the Xenomai services that may be
 * called from the handler are restricted to the set allowed to a
 * real-time interrupt handler.
 *
 * @return Zero is returned upon success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if @a pipe is not a pipe descriptor.

 * - -EIDRM is returned if @a pipe is a closed pipe descriptor.
