 * Mutex services.
 *
 * A mutex is a MUTual EXclusion object, and is useful for protecting
 * shared data structures from concurrent modifications, and
 * implementing critical sections and monitors.
 *
 * A mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by any task),
 * and locked (owned by one task). A mutex can never be owned by two
 * different tasks simultaneously. A task attempting to lock a mutex
 * that is already locked by another task is blocked until the latter
 * unlocks the mutex first.
 *
 * Xenomai mutex services enforce a priority inheritance protocol in
 * order to solve priority inversions.
