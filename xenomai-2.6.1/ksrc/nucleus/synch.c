 *
 * \brief Initialize a synchronization object.
 *
 * Initializes a new specialized object which can subsequently be used
 * to synchronize real-time activities. The Xenomai nucleus
 * provides a basic synchronization object which can be used to build
 * higher resource objects. Nucleus threads can wait for and signal
 * such objects in order to synchronize their activities.
 *
 * This object has built-in support for priority inheritance.
 *
 * @param synch The address of a synchronization object descriptor the
 * nucleus will use to store the object-specific data.  This
 * descriptor must always be valid while the object is active
 * therefore it must be allocated in permanent memory.
 *
 * @param flags A set of creation flags affecting the operation. The
 * valid flags are:
 *
 * - XNSYNCH_PRIO causes the threads waiting for the resource to pend
 * in priority order. Otherwise, FIFO ordering is used (XNSYNCH_FIFO).
 *
 * - XNSYNCH_OWNER indicates that the synchronization object shall
 * track its owning thread (required if XNSYNCH_PIP is selected). Note
 * that setting this flag implies the use xnsynch_acquire and
 * xnsynch_release instead of xnsynch_sleep_on and
 * xnsynch_wakeup_one_sleeper/xnsynch_wakeup_this_sleeper.
 *
 * - XNSYNCH_PIP causes the priority inheritance mechanism to be
 * automatically activated when a priority inversion is detected among
 * threads using this object. Otherwise, no priority inheritance takes
 * place upon priority inversion (XNSYNCH_NOPIP).
 *
 * - XNSYNCH_DREORD (Disable REORDering) tells the nucleus that the
 * wait queue should not be reordered whenever the priority of a
 * blocked thread it holds is changed. If this flag is not specified,
 * changing the priority of a blocked thread using
 * xnpod_set_thread_schedparam() will cause this object's wait queue
 * to be reordered according to the new priority level, provided the
 * synchronization object makes the waiters wait by priority order on
 * the awaited resource (XNSYNCH_PRIO).
 *
 * @param fastlock Address of the fast lock word to be associated with
 * the synchronization object. If NULL is passed or XNSYNCH_OWNER is not
 * set, fast-lock support is disabled.
 *
 * Environments:
 *
 * This service can be called from:
 *
 * - Kernel module initialization/cleanup code
 * - Kernel-based task
 * - User-space task
 *
 * Rescheduling: never.

 *
 * Side-effects:

 * inheritance boost being cleared.
 *
 * - The synchronization object ownership is transfered to the
